# Kinesis Shop (Front)

Hello, this is a quick attempt by me to create a super basic e-commerce platform!

Demo: [shop.kinesis.games](https://shop.kinesis.games)

To get started, clone this project, `cd` into the directory and just run an `npm i` followed by an `npm start`.

I won't be maintaining this project. Right now there is a some code duplication, very minor bugs and a lot of improvements to be made. I will be
checking out PRs in case anyone feels like contributing. I can't release the source code for the backend since it is very closely related to some
of my biggest projects.
